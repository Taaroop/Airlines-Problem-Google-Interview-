# Airlines-Problem-Google-Interview-
# This is my recursive approach for solving the Airlines problem from a Mock Google Coding Interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz9tKlF431k)
# The algorithm returns the minimum list of peripheral airports to which the airline must connect the central airport to enable passengers to reach all airports from the central airport.
